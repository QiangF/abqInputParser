# abqInputParser
Parser for Abaqus input file

## Introduction

**abqInputParser** is the parser for finite element software Abaqus, written in Python. It parses the FEA input data into a format that can be accessed just like the python scripting interface for Abaqus. The purpose is to provide the ability to display/modify the FEA model without using Abaqus/CAE. Also, the FEA model data will be able to transfer into other formats (such as JSON, XML, VTK). 

In the long term goal, abqInputParser will be an important component of the full finite element package alphaFEA to ensure compatibility between alphaFEA and Abaqus. 

## Usage

**abqInputParser** is under development.
